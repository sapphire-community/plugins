## Description

When writing a bot you often have many external utility functions and to have some centralized place to access them from it is useful to have an automatically imported utilities store. This plugin provides a store that you can fill with utility functions and access them from the container.

**Please note that utility functions are available on the Sapphire `container` only after the bot has logged in, any functions required before logging in should be exported through normal module loading means.**

## Installation

`@sapphire/plugin-utilities-store` depends on the following packages. Be sure to install these along with this package!

-   [`@sapphire/framework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/framework)

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/plugin-utilities-store
```

---

## Usage

Start by importing the registration file in your project to use the plugin:

**JavaScript**

```javascript
require('@sapphire/plugin-utilities-store/register');
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import '@sapphire/plugin-utilities-store/register';
```

-   Create a new `utilities` directory under `/src`
-   Make your first utility piece:

```typescript
import { Utility } from '@sapphire/plugin-utilities-store';

export class SumUtility extends Utility {
	public constructor(context: Utility.LoaderContext, options: Utility.Options) {
		super(context, {
			...options,
			name: 'sum'
		});
	}

	public add(numberOne: number, numberTwo: number) {
		return numberOne + numberTwo;
	}

	public subtract(numberOne: number, numberTwo: number) {
		return numberOne - numberTwo;
	}
}
```

In this example we simply add and subtract two numbers. You can pass any arguments you wish to the utility function, and it will execute as written.

In order for TypeScript to know about your utility functions and their arguments you need to do leverage module augmentation. `SumUtility` here is the piece class as defined in the example above.

```typescript
declare module '@sapphire/plugin-utilities-store' {
	export interface Utilities {
		sum: SumUtility;
	}
}
```
